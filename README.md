# Judo-CLI
Very rudimentary command line interface meant to track club member's total hours of practice before competition

Command line interface lists data to a file named "Judo" that will contain .txt documents for each club member.  Each student's .txt file will
contain what days they attended practice and for how many hours. 

Note: This project cannot be used as is; the file path needs to be modified first before it can be used.
